2.1. Conditional Statements - 

- Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions

 - if statement
 
 -- If the if statement's condition expression evaluates to true, 
    the block of code inside the if statement is executed.
    
 --- example:
 
if (condition) //== true 
{
   //Executes
}


if (condition == true) 
{
   //Executes 
}


-- Relational Operators: 
   (comparison operators used in the condition)
 >    Greater Than
 <    Less Than
 ==   Equal To
 !=   Not Equal To
 >=   Greater Than Or Equal To
 <=   Less Than Or Equal To


--- example: 
 
 public class Program 
 {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int x = 7;
        if(x < 42) 
        {
            System.out.println("Hi");
        }
    }
}


-!- (==) / (=)
    Two/2 equal signs signs (==) to test for equality, since a single equal sign is the assignment operator.
    One/1 equal signs (=) to a assignment operator.
