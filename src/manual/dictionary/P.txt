<package> ***- 

a "package" (package structure) is equal to file structure in you operating system.
A Java package organizes Java "classes" into "namespaces", providing a unique "namespace" for each type it contains. 
"classes" in the same package can access each other's "package private" and "protected members". 
Java "packages" can be stored in compressed files called "JAR" files, allowing classes to be downloaded faster as groups rather than individually.
In general, a package can contain the following kinds of types: 
"classes", "interfaces", "enumerations", "annotation" types. 
A "package" allows a developer to group "classes" (and interfaces) together. 
These "classes" will all be related in some way – they might all have to do with a specific application or perform a specific set of tasks. 
Programmers also typically use "packages" to organize classes belonging to the same category (subject)  or providing similar functionality.
