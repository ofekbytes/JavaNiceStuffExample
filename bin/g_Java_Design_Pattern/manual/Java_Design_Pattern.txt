Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. 
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. 
These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.


- Types of Design Patterns
-- As per the design pattern reference book Design Patterns - 
   Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software , 
   there are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories: 
   Creational, Structural, Behavioral patterns, J2EE design patterns.


- Creational Patterns
-- These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, 
   rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. 
   This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
   
- Structural Patterns
  These design patterns concern class and object composition. 
  Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
  
- Behavioral Patterns
-- These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

- J2EE Patterns
-- These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. 
   These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
